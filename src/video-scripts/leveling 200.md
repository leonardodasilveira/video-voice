this video is kai explaining the leveling strategy from 200 to 205.

it has become easy to level before level 200, so this is the first time grinding is unavoidable, so newer players might not be used to long training sessions.
let's take this into account on our tone.

Hello! As we leave the easy path of questing, arcane river introduce the need to grinding. Before any long training session, we like to prepare as players, before we prepare the character. Make sure to get into confortable clothing, stay hidrated, go to the bathroom and have snaks. blast some music, or have a movie, or your favorite youtuber talking on the background.
training can get repetitive, so distracting ourselves will make time passing feels faster.
In arcane river, some sections of each major zones are gated by level. so as a fresh 200, our first job is level to 205, so we can unlock reverse city.
Khali is a very mobile class, which can perform in some maps most classes cant. this is good, because we want good burning stages to help boost our exp per hour.
we always suggest dividing your traning in half an hour sessions, and we will use our coupons to track that for us.
make sure to have your battle analyzer always running, so we are sure we are achieving our target exp rate. remember, going into event portals, like frito's, will stop your analyzer.
with that out of the way, lets look at some maps.
